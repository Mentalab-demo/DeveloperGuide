# DeveloperGuide

This repository will contain detailed information about the software development at Mentalab.

Github webpage link: https://mentalab-demo.github.io/DeveloperGuide/

However, for now, the documentation will be done on [Github wiki](https://github.com/Mentalab-demo/DeveloperGuide/wiki) as it seems much more convenient.
